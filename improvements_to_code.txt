1. Move UI delegates, datasource to ViewController
2. rename - function --> reloadViewModel to 'flushViewModel'
3. mapKingToBattles --> split each block unit into logical functions
4. move network fetch to 'viewWillAppear' - it'll  fetch everytime it's shown


//	More Improvements
1. 'King' object should conform to a Genereic type.

// Observations
1. Init KingDetailViewModel - only if 'King' is provided
2. navigateToKingDetails - block is reduced much
3. Improve - 'navigateToKingDetails' function
4. [weak self] instead of weak var self in -> in Network completion block
